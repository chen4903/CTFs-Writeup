# Climber

## analyse

### 1.overview

There are a lot of contract:

- ClimberTimelock: controls the ClimberVault
- ClimberVault: holds the asset and uses UUPS pattern
- UUPS, etc. : UUPS pattern

In this level, our goal is to get the entire money in the ClimberVault

### 2.analyses

We can get the entire money by `sweepFunds()` while it can be called only by ClimberTimelock and transfers to ClimberTimelock . But we can upgrade the contract because of UUPS pattern.

ClimberTimelock contract is important since it holds a lot of authority. In this level, there is some problem with execute() which we can exploit. In normal situation, the execution is that: call `schedule()` first, and then call `execute()`. `schedule()` can only be called by PROPOSER_ROLE but everyone can call `execute()`.

So we, a normal member, not PROPOSER_ROLE, can exploit `execute()`. In this function, it executes `functionCallWithValue()` first which contains call() in `address.sol` library and then check if `operations[id].executed = true;` that only can be set in `schedule()`. It means everyone can call `execute` with the proposals containing making our proposals true.

```solidity
    function execute(
        address[] calldata targets,
        uint256[] calldata values,
        bytes[] calldata dataElements,
        bytes32 salt
    ) external payable {
        require(targets.length > 0, "Must provide at least one target");
        require(targets.length == values.length);
        require(targets.length == dataElements.length);

        bytes32 id = getOperationId(targets, values, dataElements, salt);

        for (uint8 i = 0; i < targets.length; i++) {
            targets[i].functionCallWithValue(dataElements[i], values[i]);
        }
        
        require(getOperationState(id) == OperationState.ReadyForExecution);
        operations[id].executed = true;
    }
```

So our idea is that:

1. make delay to zero so that we can attack right now.
2. grant PROPOSER_ROLE to attack contract
3. upgrade climbervalut which contains a new `sweepFunds()`. and this new `sweepFunds()` can be call by the attack contract and send money to the attack contract.
