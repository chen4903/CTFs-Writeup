## analyse

### 1.overview

In this level, there is a walletRegistry. As long as someone registries a gnosis wallet, he can get 10 DVT. Up to now, 4 guys have registered, but they haven't called `proxyCreated()`. Our goal is to their DVTs in total 40.

There is only one contract providing us. In fact, it involves several other contracts, especially GnosisSafeProxyFactory and GnosisSafe.

### 2.theory of gnosis wallet

Creating a gnosis wallet is cheap because it uses clone pattern which doesn't need to deploy the entire logic contract. 

To solve this level, we must know how gnosis wallet works and is created.

The proxy contract is created in GnosisSafeProxyFactory contract. And we can create a gnosis wallet by `createProxyWithCallback()`. Attention, it contains a variable named initializer which we can exploit while it is used to initialized the wallet.

```solidity
    function createProxyWithCallback(
        address _singleton,
        bytes memory initializer,
        uint256 saltNonce,
        IProxyCreationCallback callback
    ) public returns (GnosisSafeProxy proxy) {
        uint256 saltNonceWithCallback = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(saltNonce, callback)));
        proxy = createProxyWithNonce(_singleton, initializer, saltNonceWithCallback);
        if (address(callback) != address(0)) callback.proxyCreated(proxy, _singleton, initializer, saltNonce);
    }
```

And then, `createProxyWithCallback()` will call `createProxyWithNonce()`. It will call the initializer to initialized as long as it doesn't wrong.

```solidity
    function createProxyWithNonce(
        address _singleton,
        bytes memory initializer,
        uint256 saltNonce
    ) public returns (GnosisSafeProxy proxy) {
        proxy = deployProxyWithNonce(_singleton, initializer, saltNonce);
        if (initializer.length > 0)
            // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
            assembly {
                if eq(call(gas(), proxy, 0, add(initializer, 0x20), mload(initializer), 0, 0), 0) {
                    revert(0, 0)
                }
            }
        emit ProxyCreation(proxy, _singleton);
    }
```

After that, it will call `deployProxyWithNonce()` which uses `CREATE2` to create a wallet. By the way, the bytecode in `CREATE2` is constant because it uses clone pattern.

```solidity
    function deployProxyWithNonce(
        address _singleton,
        bytes memory initializer,
        uint256 saltNonce
    ) internal returns (GnosisSafeProxy proxy) {
        // If the initializer changes the proxy address should change too. Hashing the initializer data is cheaper than just concatinating it
        bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(keccak256(initializer), saltNonce));
        bytes memory deploymentData = abi.encodePacked(type(GnosisSafeProxy).creationCode, uint256(uint160(_singleton)));
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
        assembly {
            proxy := create2(0x0, add(0x20, deploymentData), mload(deploymentData), salt)
        }
        require(address(proxy) != address(0), "Create2 call failed");
    }
```

### 3.attack logic

As we know, they four registered but don't call `proxyCreated()` to get 10 DET yet. We help them to call because there is no limit. So we can exploit during  help them :)

There are a lot of `require()` in it, let's analyses it:

- `require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= TOKEN_PAYMENT, "Not enough funds to pay");`: the level contract should hold enough DVT.
- `require(msg.sender == walletFactory, "Caller must be factory");`: Only GnosisSafeProxyFactory can call it.
- `require(singleton == masterCopy, "Fake mastercopy used");`: we can only create the same wallet which is masterCopy
- `require(bytes4(initializer[:4]) == GnosisSafe.setup.selector, "Wrong initialization");`: the wallet must initialized by `setup()`. We can exploit in it! Because we can pass any data in `setup()`
- `require(GnosisSafe(walletAddress).getThreshold() == MAX_THRESHOLD, "Invalid threshold");`: Threshold must be 1.
- `require(GnosisSafe(walletAddress).getOwners().length == MAX_OWNERS, "Invalid number of owners");` : there must be only one owner.
- `require(beneficiaries[walletOwner], "Owner is not registered as beneficiary");`: the owner must registry in this contract.

We know we can do something in `setup()`. the wallet someone creates will call `setup()`  and then it will do something with `to` and `data`. If the `data` contains `approve()`, `to` can use `transferFrom` to  transfer wallet's DVT!

```solidity
    function setup(
        address[] calldata _owners,
        uint256 _threshold,
        address to,
        bytes calldata data,
        address fallbackHandler,
        address paymentToken,
        uint256 payment,
        address payable paymentReceiver
    ) external {
        // setupOwners checks if the Threshold is already set, therefore preventing that this method is called twice
        setupOwners(_owners, _threshold);
        if (fallbackHandler != address(0)) internalSetFallbackHandler(fallbackHandler);
        // As setupOwners can only be called if the contract has not been initialized we don't need a check for setupModules
        setupModules(to, data);

        if (payment > 0) {
            // To avoid running into issues with EIP-170 we reuse the handlePayment function (to avoid adjusting code of that has been verified we do not adjust the method itself)
            // baseGas = 0, gasPrice = 1 and gas = payment => amount = (payment + 0) * 1 = payment
            handlePayment(payment, 0, 1, paymentToken, paymentReceiver);
        }
        emit SafeSetup(msg.sender, _owners, _threshold, to, fallbackHandler);
    }
```

So our attack is that: build a data with `approve()` as initializer to create the wallet. Then we can call `transferFrom()`  to steal DVT!
